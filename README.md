# VerDICT - Visualisation of Disease-Gene Predictions in Context

According to the recently developed paradigm of Network Medicine, hereditary diseases can be thought of as perturbations in the transmission of signals on networks of interacting biomolecules, known as the interactome. Several algorithms have recently been proposed that exploit the principles of Network medicine to predict disease genes for hereditary diseases. However, no tool currently exists that allows the clinician scientists to visualise the predicted disease genes in the context of the interactome.  This project aims at filling this gap, by developing VerDICT, an intuitive, user-friendly environment where clinician-scientists can reason about the predictions generated by the algorithms and generate a hypothesis to test experimentally. The program allows the users to include in their analysis of metabolic pathways, information about related medical conditions as well as user-specific domain knowledge in the form of custom groups of genes. VerDICT is highly customizable, it integrates data from the most relevant disease-related database, OMIM, Kegg and Entrez, and is freely available to the scientific community as a web application from the [PaccanaroLab website](https://www.paccanarolab.org/VerDICT).
